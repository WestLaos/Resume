# Resume
This repo contains several coding projects which I have contributed to. 

# Unity Game Techcore (C#)
This is a game that I helped make during my internship at Tech Core at the University
of Arizona. All of the scripts can be found here Unity-Game-Techcore-(C#)/Assets/Scripts/
my main contributions were to MapGenerator.cs, AnimationController.cs, Destructible.cs, 
and PickUpWeapons.cs. I also helped with some minor bug fixes in the PlayerController.cs. 

# Wordle (Java)
This is a Java implementation of the popular game Wordle. The game can be played through
a GUI made using JavaFX and through a console-based ui by starting the code with the command
line argument "-line". 

# Auto Complete (C)
This is a basic C implementation of a word autocomplete program. The program takes in a txt
file as an argument and creates a word tree representing every word in it. Then, the 
program takes in a string input and prints out any words from the text file that
start with the given input.

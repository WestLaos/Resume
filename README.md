# Resume
This repo contains several coding projects which I have contributed to. 

# Unity Game Techcore (C#)
This is a game which I helped make during my intership at techcore at the University
of Arizona. All of the scripts can be found here Unity-Game-Techcore-(C#)/Assets/Scripts/
my main contributions were to MapGenerator.cs, AnimationController.cs, Desctructible.cs
and PickUpWeapons.cs. As well as helping with some minor bug fixes in the player controller. 

# Wordle (Java)
This is a java implementation of the popular game wordle. The game can both be played through
a gui made using javafx and through a console based ui by starting the code with the command
line argument -line 

# Auto Complete (C)
This is a basic C implmentation of a word autocomplete program. The file takes in a text
file as an argument and will create a word tree representing every word in it. Then the 
file takes in a string input and prints out any of the words from the text file which
start with the given input.
